    <h2>Street Fighter</h2>

    <p>
      Over the years the Street Fighter franchise has given us some ups and downs, sometimes both at the same time depending on who you ask, but unquestionably the Street Fighter name brings with it a whole ensemble of expectations.
    </p>
    <p>
      The image you have in your head when someone says "Street Fighter" is most likely the classic 2 characters squaring off whilst they move back and forth across a 2D plane and punch or kick each other until one of their health bars empties at which point a big "K.O." sign appears on the screen and the winner taunts the loser. While not a million miles away from the origin of what Street Fighter originally was it might be a little further than you think.
    </p>
    <p>
      Originally designed as a side-scrolling beat 'em up, the first Street Fighter game only featured what you would recognize at Street Fightin' at the end of each level as a boss fight. Also no Hadoukens. But Ryu and Ken did exist!
    </p>
    <p>
      Street Fighter was the first game to introduce the six-button standard, and to use command-based special moves. Imagine where we'd be with no Dragon Punch.
    </p>
    <h2>Street Fighter II</h2>
    <p>
      Unfortunately for Street Fighter 1, it's sequel was Street Fighter II. Back in the days when sequels were essentially strict improvements over their predecessors, shame those days aren't with us anymore.
    </p>
    <p>
      Street Fighter II brought with it a whole bunch of improvements and augments to the original formula, nothing was changed fundamentally but all of the systems were either added to or refined to trim some of the fat, so to speak.
