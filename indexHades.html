      <h2>Your first run</h2>
      <p>
        You boot up Hades for the first time, navigate immediately to the setting to set those up exactly as you want because you've played video games before, and journey all the way back up to the 'play' button. A small voice over introduction and some strange person drops into the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        Boom you're in control, no overlong cutscene setting up the world, no lengthy tutorial just drop in and play. The game displays a small guide in the top corner telling you what each of the buttons on your controller (or keyboard if you want a worse experience) do and you're off.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before you know it you're doing the roguelike combo; clearing rooms, getting upgrades, growing bigger, getting spicy, flaming waffles, fluffing whamblers, gribbling humknees. Now it's your first run so you have no idea what's good and what's not. The game does a great job of communicating the details of what each option does but without context '23% increased damage' doesn't really help you figure out if that ability is strong or not (I'd just like to make it known that, in my opinion, this is the <em>strictly superior option</em> but it can be a little overwhelming).
      </p>
      <h2>Your next 50-ish runs</h2>
      <p>
        Now, I have a little problem with some roguelikes; there's too many options. This is a problem for me because when I'm playing other roguelikes, namely Dead Cells and Balatro, I feel like there's no way I can steer a build in the direction I want until I'm powerful enough that I don't need to, unless I'm getting near ante 12 in Balatro but that's another story.
      </p>
      <p>
        This isn't always a problem as sometimes it's fun to have to react to the choices the game gives you and make it work, no two runs are the same and all that. It's also really fun to be able to prepare for a run extensively and then see all that preparation come together during the run, and you learn where your shortcomings are or where you can improve so that you're next preparation is more effective.
